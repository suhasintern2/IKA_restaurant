# ARCHITECTURE.md — TIL SYSTEM

## 1. High-level split
Backend (this repo) and frontend (teammate's repo) are separate. Backend
exposes a REST API; frontend consumes it per `frontend_spec.md`.

## 2. Backend responsibilities (FastAPI)
- Receive single or bulk image uploads
- Receive bulk ticket screenshots and merge them into ticket records by Ticket ID
- Receive bulk discrepancy dockets and preserve printed OCR separately from handwriting
- Run text extraction on images (OCR with preprocessing + OSD deskew)
- Parse ticket screenshots and docket images into separate fixed field sets;
  missing values are null and unknown labels go to `extra_fields`
- Segment the text into blocks (header / metadata / line items / discrepancy
  markers / totals / payment) and bind each marker to its line item
- Persist rows (including the structured `blocks` JSON)
- Reconcile ticket records against image entries using ticket number as the
  primary match key and restaurant + date + amount as a fallback only when
  the numbers are absent or incomparable
- Capture handwritten reasons as a separate field and assess whether the note
  plausibly addresses the discrepancy with explicit operator-review evidence
- Serve the table data to the frontend
- Generate CSV export

## 4. Data flow

    [image upload] -> [FastAPI /upload or /upload/bulk] -> [OCR extraction (preprocess + Tesseract)]
        -> [parse_extracted_text (fields + blocks/segment_text)]
        -> [determine_status (precedence; low-confidence marker -> needs_review)]
        -> [structured row + blocks JSON stored in DB]
        -> [/entries returns table data] -> [frontend renders table]
        -> [/export returns CSV of current table/filtered view]

      Bulk image uploads are processed synchronously, one image at a time through
      the same extraction/parsing/persistence pipeline as `/upload`. The bulk route
      accepts up to 30 images and isolates exceptions per image, returning stored
      successes alongside filename/reason failures. No background job or polling is
      required for the current MVP contract; the frontend can refresh `/entries`
      after the request completes.

      Ticket screenshot batches use `/api/upload/tickets`, OCR each screenshot,
      normalize its Ticket ID, and upsert one SQLite `ticket_records` row. The
      row stores flexible ticket fields, `extra_fields`, deduplicated item rows,
      raw OCR text, and screenshot filenames. Screenshots are saved under
      `data/uploads/ticket_screenshots/`; item merge keys are normalized item
      name + quantity + unit price, and void rows retain `is_void: true`.
      The generic `/api/upload` and `/api/upload/bulk` paths inspect OCR before
      accepting an image; a full Ticket ID plus ticket-screen labels is routed
      into `ticket_records` and `ticket_screenshots` instead of `entries`.
      Unrecognized non-ticket images are rejected from the generic path and
      must use the dedicated docket endpoint. Ticket IDs remain one
      hyphenated string such as `260920-143`.

      Docket batches use `/api/upload/dockets`, save images under
      `data/uploads/dockets/`, and create one `docket_records` row per image.
      The parser stores `docket_order_no` as a weak trailing-order key, docket
      date/time, item, printed discrepancy type, separate `handwritten_reason`,
      printed/raw OCR, and review flags. Multiple detected order numbers cause
      manual review; the endpoint never invents a full Ticket ID.

      Void reconciliation reads `ticket_records.items` where `is_void` is true
      and matches each item to `docket_records.docket_order_no` using the
      trailing Ticket ID digits. A unique date match resolves a collision;
      unresolved collisions retain every candidate and become `needs_review`.
      The builder sorts `matched`, then `needs_review`, then `unmatched`, adds
      `row_position`, and is shared by both the JSON and CSV endpoints.

      `/api/tickets` returns one merged ticket row with prominent `ticket_id`,
      `uploaded_at` (latest screenshot upload/merge time), and its
      normalized `items[]` from the `ticket_items` child table. The frontend
      keeps the dataset collapsed until Show data and renders an expandable
      item sub-table. `/api/dockets` returns order_number, date, time, item,
      discrepancy_type, and description. Upload success is
      returned only after the inserted row is read back from its dedicated
      table.

      The generic entries dataset is not used by ticket/docket ingestion or
      the active UI. The two dedicated datasets are the only parsed record
      tables shown to operators.

## 5. Division-to-code mapping
| Division | Code location |
|---|---|
| 1. Image input + extraction | `app/api/upload.py`, `app/extraction/ocr.py` |
| 2. Table / discrepancy data | `app/models/entry.py`, `app/api/entries.py`, `app/storage/db.py` |
| 3. CSV export | `app/api/export.py` |
| 4c. Ticket reconciliation | `app/models/reconciliation.py`, `app/api/reconciliation.py` |
| Ticket screenshot input | `app/models/ticket.py`, `app/api/upload.py`, `app/storage/db.py` |
| Docket input | `app/models/docket.py`, `app/api/upload.py`, `app/storage/db.py` |
| Void reconciliation | `app/api/void_reconciliation.py`, `app/storage/db.py` |
| Parsed ticket/docket reads and CSVs | `app/api/records.py`, `app/storage/db.py` |

## 6. Open decisions (resolve and move into decisions.md)
- How ticket number / restaurant are identified from extracted text
  (regex? fixed template per restaurant? manual entry fallback?)

## 7. Resolved decisions
- OCR engine/service choice: Selected Tesseract OCR (recorded in decisions.md)
- Storage layer: Selected SQLite for MVP (simple, file-based, sufficient)
- Text parsing approach: Selected regex/keyword matching (extract ticket # and discrepancy type)
- CSV export functionality: Selected GET /export endpoint with filtering support (restaurant, ticket_number)
- CSV image representation: Selected to export stored image filename/path instead of thumbnail
- Entry model: Added extra_fields (dict) for capturing unexpected bill fields, image_filename for CSV export reference
- Status values: Expanded to matched, needs_description, needs_ticket_number, needs_restaurant, needs_discrepancy_type, needs_review
- Parsing strategy: Retained regex/rule-based over LLM; multiple patterns with graceful degradation for schema flexibility
- OCR preprocessing: grayscale -> 2x LANCZOS upscale (<1400px) -> autocontrast(cutoff=1) -> OSD deskew (rotate only at confidence >= 5.0); Tesseract `--oem 3 --psm 6`
- Block segmentation: `app/models/segmentation.py` splits the OCR blob into header / metadata / line_items / discrepancies / totals / payment; every value fix is recorded in `corrections` (auditable)
- Discrepancy association: marker binds to nearest preceding item; high confidence iff gap <= 2 lines and marker amount matches line_total; otherwise low -> status `needs_review`
- `blocks` column: additive `blocks` JSON column on entries (deserialized by `entries.py`); raw `extracted_text` kept for audit; `/upload` response `parsed_data` stays at the original 5 fields
